it should return exactly what i put up


Make view, view passes everything to db db comes back with changed view if it did anything and resource.
View may have to call db again if there is an expand.

If view syntax is empty just call db it returns resource as is.
	-View adds the oada junk to it?
		-Id it could. How does it add changeId?
		-View thingy can't add changeid. Database has to.


Question for everyone:
	-Are we disallowing _meta in json doc that is uploaded.
	-You don't put up _id when you upload a file. Is every element going to have a _id
	-Is _id relative to the document? ie. 123/blah/corn could be an id for a corn key in resource 123.
	-iphone sdk, and other libs only do get and post. Use x-http-method-override?
